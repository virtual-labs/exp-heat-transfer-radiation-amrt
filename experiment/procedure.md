### Apparatus



Emissivity measurement apparatus: The experimental set up consists of two circular aluminum plates identical in size provide with heater coils at the bottom Fig.1

It is kept in an enclosure so as to provide undisturbed natural convection surroundings. The heat input to the heaters is varied by two regulators and is measured by an ammeter and voltmeter. Each plate is having three thermocouples; hence an average temperature is taken. One thermocouple is kept in the enclosure to read the chamber temperature. One plate is blackened by a layer of enamel black paint to form the idealized black surface whereas the other plate is the test plate. The temperatures of the plates are measured by using thermocouples.
