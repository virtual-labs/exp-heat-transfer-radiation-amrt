### Theory

In radiation, energy is carried by the electromagnetic waves emitted by every object. In general, radiation is a volumetric phenomenon. This is because the electrons, atoms and molecules of all solids, liquids and gases above absolute zero temperature are in constant motion and hence energy is constantly emitted, absorbed and transmitted throughout the entire volume of the matter.
 

The radiation from a surface is emitted in all possible directions. A body at a temperature above absolute zero emits radiation in all directions over a wide range of wavelength. The amount of radiation from the surface of a body at a given temperature and at a given wavelength depends on the material of the body and nature of its surface. A concept of an idealized surface has been made which are perfect emitter and absorber of radiation. This ideal surface is known as a black body.

A black body or ideal radiator is a body that emits and absorbs at any temperature the maximum possible radiation at any given wavelength.

A black body has the following features
